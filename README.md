## My process

I just used the basic knowledge I got from University to build this component. It's my first time using a CSS style file believe it or not, since I always avoided Frontend development.

I didn't build the HTML first and then the CSS, which maybe would've helped. I'm still trying to develop a workflow to develop for the Frontend.

I used Google to figure out the specific properties I wanted to alter to get the look I wanted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about the position property which helped a lot.

I did my best to organize the content and had to use the z-index property which I don't know if it was needed.

### Continued development

I want to focus on structuring my CSS in a cleaner way, with generic styles. I still need to learn some of the best practices.

I also think I should build the HTML first and then add style with CSS.
